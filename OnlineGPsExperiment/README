This folder contains code for the Online GP experiments in non-stationary settings.

The code is based on the Dynamic Online Ensemble Basis Expansion (DOEBE) code:
https://github.com/DanWaxman/DynamicOnlineBasisExpansions

To obtain PLLs of each model, use `get_results.sh`. Then, use `compute_obs_weights.py` to compute the O-BMA and OBS weights, and `plot_obs_weights.py` to plot the results.
