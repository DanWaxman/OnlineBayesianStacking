This folder contains code for the toy example experiment with subset linear regression. It relies on a modified version of the DOEBE code, in `DOEBE/doebe.py`.

To run the experiment, use the following command:

```bash
python subset_linear_regression.py
```
This will generate the results necessary to make the plots in `results.ipynb`.
